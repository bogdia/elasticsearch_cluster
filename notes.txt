new changes in 5.2: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/breaking-changes-5.2.html

add the following line to config/logging.yml
discovery.zen.ping.unicast: DEBUG

This enables debugging logging in the relevant module


bootstrap.system_call_filter to false


add node0x to be identified
- to /etc/hosts
- as ip in discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts
- what ip should be here? all? the masters only ?
